## Accommodation

This year the format of the National Planning Conference is slightly different in that we will not be ‘hotel’ based.  The conference proceedings and gala dinner will be held in Belfast City Hall in the heart of the city and delegates will be able to stay in a number of hotel venues just a short walk from the conference venue.

Following an IPI visit to a number of hotels in the city, a dedicated web link has been created with the option of choosing accommodation from 10 no. hotels.  The IPI has selected Hastings Europa Hotel as their ‘hotel of choice’ for the conference and this is where the speakers and conference organisers will be staying.  However, delegates can also choose Jury’s Inn or The Fitwilliam Hotel which are next door to the Europa Hotel as alternative venues.  Other hotels viewed by the IPI within walking distance of Belfast City Hall includes **Holiday Inn, Park Inn, Ten Square and Malmaison**.

Accommodation is available online through this link until the 11th April 2013 at the negotiated preferential conference rates.
