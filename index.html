<h2>President’s Invitation</h2>

<p>I would like to invite you to attend the Irish Planning Institute’s 35 th Annual Conference. We are delighted that this year for the first time, the conference will take place in Belfast, Northern Ireland a dynamic and modern city that has undergone major renewal in recent years.</p>

<p>The National Planning Conference is the main event on the IPI’s calendar and it provides a forum for learning and discussion on planning issues both in Ireland and abroad, and this year in particular cross border learning will play a key role in the conference’s content. It also has of course a social and networking side, allowing delegates from all over the Ireland and abroad to get together and chat during the various breaks and particularly the conference gala dinner which is being held in the exquisite surrounds of Belfast City Hall.</p>

<p>This year’s conference aims to facilitate discussion around the changing role of planning, particularly having regard to local government reform in the south and planning reform in the north.</p>

<p>The conference title ‘Achieving Competitiveness & Promoting Innovation - The Future Role of Planning’, embodies the key themes of the conference which focus on future planning challenges from an economic, maritime and renewable energy perspective whilst also examining the role of planning in facilitating competitive cities and regions. Particular topics will include ‘new planning frameworks through reform and change – the future role of planning’, ‘diversification and innovation – adapting the role of the planner’ and ‘cities regions and competitiveness – the role of planning in economic development and investment’. Delegates will hear perspectives from national and international planning practitioners and representatives of other central stakeholders and State Agencies. We are delighted that Professor Andreas Faludi is amongst those addressing the conference. On Friday morning, prior to the day’s proceedings, there will be a tour of the historical centrepiece of Belfast City and the location of the IPI Conference, Belfast City Hall. On Friday afternoon there will be a tour of Belfast city which will take in significant sites, some of which are historically contentious and others representing the new face of the city.</p>

<p>I look forward to meeting members of the Institute, other colleagues, elected members and all those interested in planning over the two days of the 2013 National Planning Conference.</p>
